Object class
	-hidden superclass of every Java inheritance hierarchy
	public class foo{} //automatically extends object
	
	.equals(), toString()
	if(!(obj instanceof Shape)) //is the object on the left and instance of the object on the right?
	must override equals method in rectangle cause default doesn't know about width or height.
	reu=turn width == other.width && height == other.height;  //only checks the x
	must also put in overridden statement if(! superclass.equals(obj)) {return false;}
	Thereby checking the added x, and the original y.
	
	whenever you right classes, allow for toString();
	In subclass, prepare with String s = super.toString();
