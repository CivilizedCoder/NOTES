Euler circuit
	path crosses every edge once, ends where it started.
	for undirected, degree of a needs to be even, and therefore every node
	
	for directed graph, in and out degree must be equal for every node
	
	
	
Euler path
	does not end at started, crosses every edge once.
	
	MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
	
	Starting node must be odd for undirected as well as ending node, all others are even.
	2 odd, others even, = ueluers path
	
	Directed
		Starting node must have out degree one higher than in degree.
		Ending node has one more in than out-degree.
		
		
Adjecency matrix used to calculate degrees. = all you need.
Adj. List doesn't store 0s.
