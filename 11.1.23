Graphs
	set of nodes connected by edges
	think of it in the drawn out form.
	graphs also called networks as they can well represent road (etc.)  networks
	Mathematical V(G) = {A,B,C} list of Vertices
	E(G) = {(A,C), (B,C)} list of edges
	directed graphs hold one-way streets (Edges)
	E(G) = {<A,C>, <B,C>, <C,A>} 
	restrictions of graphs for computerscience reasons
		no channal from point a to point a 
		no identical edges (unless limit to use per edge)
	
	
	N = number of nodes in the graphs
	E = number of edges in the graphs
	Adjacency = direct travel from one to the other
	Subgraph = smaller piece, "Graphs are just sets, you can have a subset."
	
	In-degree of node = number of edges that can go in.
	Out-degree of node = number of edges that can go out.
	degree of node = total connections per node.
	
	complete graph = graph with max num of possible edges (no dupes, no a-a connection)
		for undirected graph = N*(N-1)/2
		for directed graph = N*(N-1)
	
	connected graph = no rogue nodes (or series of nodes)
	
	Strongly connected = move from any point a to any point x (indirectly)
		undirected connected graphs are inherently strongly connected
		Untrue of directed graphs
		
	Biconnected = no articulation points (No node would destroy complete graph when removed) = good
	
	Path = sequence of nodes that take you from node a - node c. (A-B-C) or (A-B-C-B-A)
	
	simple path = every node is unique(Except first and last) = good
	cycle is a path with same first and last node (A-B-C-A)
		if untrue, path is acyclic
		
		
		



1) Graph #1 is strongly connected, as it is a connected and undirected. Graph #2 is not strongly connected, as you cannot move from node B to node E.

2) Neither graph forces any one sequence to make a cycle.

3) What is the degree of each vertex? If the graph is directed, provide the in-degree and outdegree of each vertex.

Graph #1 degree of A = 3, B = 2, C = 2, D = 3, E = 2.

Graoh #2

Node,  in-degree:out-degree

A,            1:2

B,            2:1

C,           2:1

D,           1:1

E,            0:1 

4) Neither graph is complete, Graph #1 requires a total of 10 edges to be complete, and Graph #2 requires 20 edges to be complete.

5) For Graph #1 is {(A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,E), (A,B), (E,D), (D,C)}.

For Graph #2 is {}.
