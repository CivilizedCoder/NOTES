DATE/TIME QUESTIONS:

Data types
	
	byte     1 byte      256  (0-255) (-128 to 127)
						adding one to 127 = -128 (overflow)
						subtracting 1 from -128 = 127 (underflow)
	short    2 bytes     
	int      4 bytes
	long     8 bytes
		All can hold intagers
		All are signed (hold negative and positive numbers)
	
	char
		holds ascii/unicode vals and is therefore unsigned. Holds 2 bytes
		
		
		
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
						   .of();   // typical of factory pattern. Static method on a class that gives you instances.
Period difference = Period.between(christmas, notChristmas);
Period age = Period.between(birhdate, LocalDate.now();

Packages:
	import java.util.Scanner; //read like directory path. Somewhere on computer is directory java/util/Scanner.class
	classpath
		set of root directories to look in for imports
		claspath=c:\foo\util;c:\javalib
		c:\foo\util\java\util\Scanner.class first, then
		
		
		
	package foo //subdirectory named foo
	import foo.util.mySub
	
	
	public class foo{
	private in x;
	
	private/public/protected int setX() {x = 1;}
	void setX(){x = 1;} //this has packeage access. every class within package can access method.
	}
	
	.jar file is .zip file renamed with a specific directory structure. It can be used as part of a class path. //can still be unzipped to see what's inside
	
	There is a standard for package naming, like websites.
	IndustrialLighting.com
	com.IndustrialLighting.util
	org.mynet.util
	//Start getting a feel for how packages work.
